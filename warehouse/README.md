# 🏭 Warehouse Grid Design (Python)

This project models a **warehouse layout** using a **grid-based representation**.  
It includes shelves, robot movement lanes, docking stations, a packing area, and a truck bay — without any inventory or robot movement logic.

---

Design Principles:

Grid model: Discrete 2D cells representing warehouse space.
Validation: Prevents overlaps and out-of-bounds placements.
Extensibility: Ready to connect with inventory or robot modules later.
Modular: Clean separation between models, layout logic, and example/demo.
